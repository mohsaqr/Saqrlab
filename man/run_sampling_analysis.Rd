\title{Run Sampling Analysis on TNA Models}
\usage{
run_sampling_analysis(
  model,
  sampling_percent = 0.3,
  iterations = 100,
  seed = NULL,
  model_scaling = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A TNA model object created with tna() or related functions.}

\item{sampling_percent}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the
proportion of data to use for the sample model. Default: 0.3.}

\item{iterations}{Integer specifying the number of sampling iterations.
Default: 100.}

\item{seed}{Integer seed for reproducible random sampling. Default: NULL.}

\item{model_scaling}{Character string to override the model's scaling:
NULL (default) uses original model's scaling, "skip" forces no scaling,
or valid TNA scaling options ("minmax", "max", "rank").}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print progress messages. Default: TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{aggregated}{Data frame with aggregated summary statistics by metric.}
\item{individual}{Data frame with raw metric values from each iteration.}
\item{params}{Parameters used for the analysis.}
}
}
\description{
Perform comprehensive TNA model analysis through repeated sampling and
statistical comparison. Uses a statistically correct sampling procedure
by comparing models built on independent data subsets (sample vs remaining).
}
\details{
This function implements a statistically correct sampling procedure:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Data Splitting}: For each iteration, splits the original data into:
\itemize{
\item Sample set (specified percentage)
\item Remaining set (complement)
}
\item \strong{Model Building}: Builds TNA models on both datasets using the
original model's type and configurable scaling.
\item \strong{Model Comparison}: Compares sample model vs remaining model using
TNA's compare() function, providing metrics across categories:
\itemize{
\item Correlations (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall)
\item Dissimilarities (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.)
\item Similarities (Cosine, Jaccard, etc.)
}
\item \strong{Result Aggregation}: Collects metrics across all iterations
and computes summary statistics (mean, sd, median, quartiles).
}

This approach is statistically superior to comparing sample vs original
because it compares models built on independent data subsets, providing
a true measure of sampling variability and model stability.
