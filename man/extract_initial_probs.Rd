\title{Extract Initial Probabilities from Model}
\usage{
extract_initial_probs(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A TNA model object or a list containing an 'initial' element.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of initial state probabilities.
}
\description{
Extract the initial state probability vector from a TNA model object.
}
\details{
Initial probabilities represent the probability of starting a sequence in
each state. If the model doesn't have explicit initial probabilities,
this function attempts to estimate them from the data or use uniform
probabilities.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Extract initial probabilities from fitted model
model <- tna::tna(sequences)
init_probs <- extract_initial_probs(model)
print(init_probs)
}
