\title{Calculate Edge Recovery Metrics}
\usage{
compare_edge_recovery(
  original,
  simulated,
  threshold = 0.01,
  return_edges = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{original}{A TNA model object (the original/ground truth model).}

\item{simulated}{A TNA model object (the simulated/recovered model).}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. Minimum edge weight to consider an edge as
"present". Default: 0.01.}

\item{return_edges}{Logical. Whether to return detailed edge-level results.
Default: FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item true_positives: Number of edges correctly present in both.
\item false_positives: Number of edges present in simulated but not original.
\item false_negatives: Number of edges present in original but not simulated.
\item true_negatives: Number of edges correctly absent in both.
\item precision: TP / (TP + FP).
\item recall: TP / (TP + FN), also known as sensitivity.
\item f1_score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
\item accuracy: (TP + TN) / total edges.
\item jaccard: TP / (TP + FP + FN), Jaccard similarity.
\item edges: (Optional) Data frame with edge-level results.
}
}
\description{
Calculate metrics for how well edges from an original network are recovered
in a simulated/comparison network.
}
\details{
This function treats edge recovery as a binary classification problem:
\itemize{
\item True Positive: Edge present in both original and simulated.
\item False Positive: Edge present in simulated but not original.
\item False Negative: Edge present in original but not simulated.
\item True Negative: Edge absent in both.
}

An edge is considered "present" if its weight exceeds the threshold.

# Calculate edge recovery
