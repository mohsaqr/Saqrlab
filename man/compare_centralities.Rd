\title{Compare Centrality Profiles}
\usage{
compare_centralities(
  model1,
  model2,
  measures = c("OutStrength", "InStrength", "Betweenness"),
  method = c("both", "correlation", "rank")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model1}{A TNA model object (the reference/original model).}

\item{model2}{A TNA model object (the comparison/simulated model).}

\item{measures}{Character vector. Centrality measures to compare. Options:
"OutStrength", "InStrength", "Betweenness", "Closeness", or "all".
Default: c("OutStrength", "InStrength", "Betweenness").}

\item{method}{Character. Comparison method: "correlation" (Pearson),
"rank" (Spearman), or "both". Default: "both".}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item correlations: Named list of correlation values by measure.
\item centrality_comparison: Data frame with centrality values for each state.
\item summary: Character summary of the comparison.
}
}
\description{
Compare centrality measures between two TNA networks using correlation
or rank-based methods.
}
\details{
Centrality measures are extracted from the TNA model objects using
\code{tna::centralities()}. The function compares how well the centrality
profiles are preserved between the original and simulated/comparison model.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Compare centrality profiles between models
comparison <- compare_centralities(model_original, model_simulated)
print(comparison$correlations)
}
