\title{Learning State Verbs for TNA Simulation}
\format{
A named list with 8 categories of learning verbs.
}
\usage{
LEARNING_STATES
}
\description{
Predefined collections of student learning action verbs organized by
category. These can be used as state names when generating TNA networks
to simulate realistic student learning behavior sequences.
}
\details{
The verbs are organized into seven categories based on learning science:

\describe{
\item{metacognitive}{Self-regulation and awareness actions:
planning, monitoring, evaluating one's own learning.}
\item{cognitive}{Mental processing actions:
understanding, analyzing, synthesizing information.}
\item{behavioral}{Observable study actions:
reading, writing, practicing, note-taking.}
\item{social}{Interaction and collaboration actions:
discussing, helping, teaching, asking.}
\item{motivational}{Effort and persistence actions:
focusing, persisting, engaging, striving.}
\item{affective}{Emotional and attitudinal states:
enjoying, coping, managing stress, curiosity.}
\item{group_regulation}{Socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL):
collaborative planning, monitoring, adapting in groups.}
\item{lms}{Learning Management System actions:
viewing content, accessing resources, submitting assignments, forum posts.}
}
}
