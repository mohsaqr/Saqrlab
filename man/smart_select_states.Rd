\usage{
smart_select_states(
  n_states,
  primary_categories = NULL,
  secondary_categories = NULL,
  primary_ratio = 0.6,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_states}{Integer. Number of states needed.}

\item{primary_categories}{Character vector. Categories to prioritize.
Default: NULL (balanced selection).}

\item{secondary_categories}{Character vector. Categories to supplement with.
Default: NULL (use all remaining).}

\item{primary_ratio}{Numeric (0 to 1). Proportion of states from primary
categories. Default: 0.6.}

\item{seed}{Integer or NULL. Random seed. Default: NULL.}
}
\value{
Character vector of selected learning states.
}
\description{
Intelligently select learning states based on the number of nodes needed,
optionally biasing toward specific categories.
}
\details{
Selection logic:
\itemize{
\item If n_states <= 5: Single category or balanced small set
\item If n_states 6-10: 1-2 categories prioritized
\item If n_states 11-20: Multiple categories with primary focus
\item If n_states > 20: All categories combined
}
}
\examples{
# 5 states focused on self-regulation
smart_select_states(5, primary_categories = "metacognitive")

# 10 states: mostly cognitive, some behavioral
smart_select_states(10,
  primary_categories = "cognitive",
  secondary_categories = "behavioral"
)

# 15 states: balanced across categories
smart_select_states(15, seed = 42)
