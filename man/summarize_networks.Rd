\usage{
summarize_networks(
  model_list,
  include = c("density", "centrality", "edges"),
  threshold = 0.01,
  centrality_measures = c("OutStrength", "InStrength")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_list}{A list of TNA model objects.}

\item{include}{Character vector. What to include in the summary.
Options: "density" (network density), "centrality" (centrality measures),
"edges" (edge weight statistics), or "all" for everything.
Default: c("density", "centrality", "edges").}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. Minimum edge weight to consider present for
density calculation. Default: 0.01.}

\item{centrality_measures}{Character vector. Which centrality measures
to summarize. Default: c("OutStrength", "InStrength").}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item summary_table: Data frame with per-network statistics.
\item aggregate: Named list of aggregate statistics across all networks.
\item n_networks: Number of networks summarized.
}
}
\description{
Compute aggregate statistics across multiple TNA network models.
}
\details{
This function is useful for summarizing results from simulation studies
where many networks are generated. It provides both per-network and
aggregate statistics.
