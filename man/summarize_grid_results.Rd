\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{n_selected}{Number of settings matching the filter criteria.}
\item{aggregated_summary}{List with:
\itemize{
\item overall_performance: Averaged metrics across settings.
\item edge_significance: Aggregated edge-level statistics.
}
}
\item{selected_settings_summary_df}{Data frame with per-setting metrics
calculated from total TP/TN/FP/FN counts.}
\item{compiled_individual_runs}{List with detailed run-level data:
\itemize{
\item all_raw_summaries: Combined bootstrap summaries.
\item all_per_edge_performance: Combined per-edge results.
\item run_level_performance_metrics: Metrics per run.
\item setting_level_summary_stats: Mean/Median/SD of run metrics.
}
}
}
Returns NULL (invisibly) if no settings match.
}
\description{
Summarize results from \code{run_grid_simulation()}, filtering by parameter ranges
and computing aggregated performance metrics. Provides detailed summaries
at both the setting level and across all selected settings.
}
\details{
The function performs comprehensive analysis:

\strong{Filtering}: Selects settings where all parameters fall within specified ranges.

\strong{Aggregation from Input Summaries}: Extracts and averages overall performance
and edge significance from the original \code{aggregated_summary} in each setting.

\strong{Run-Level Metrics}: Recomputes TP/TN/FP/FN counts from per-edge data,
then calculates Sensitivity, Specificity, FPR, FNR, Accuracy, and MCC per run.

\strong{Setting-Level Metrics}: Two approaches:
\enumerate{
\item Mean/Median/SD of run-level metrics.
\item Metrics computed from total counts across all runs (more robust).
}

The \code{selected_settings_summary_df} uses approach #2 for the most accurate
overall metrics per setting.
