\title{Compare Two TNA Networks}
\usage{
compare_networks(
  model1,
  model2,
  metrics = c("correlation", "rmse", "edge_diff"),
  scaling = c("none", "minmax", "zscore"),
  include_self = TRUE,
  threshold = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model1}{A TNA model object (the reference/original model).}

\item{model2}{A TNA model object (the comparison/simulated model).}

\item{metrics}{Character vector. Metrics to compute. Options:
"correlation" (Pearson correlation), "rmse" (root mean square error),
"mae" (mean absolute error), "edge_diff" (proportion with large differences),
"cosine" (cosine similarity), or "all" to compute everything.
Default: c("correlation", "rmse", "edge_diff").}

\item{scaling}{Character. How to scale edge weights before comparison.
Options: "none" (no scaling), "minmax" (min-max normalization to 0-1),
"zscore" (z-score standardization). Default: "none".}

\item{include_self}{Logical. Whether to include self-loops in comparison.
Default: TRUE.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. Threshold for considering an edge as "different"
in edge_diff metric. Default: 0.05.}
}
\value{
A list with class "tna_comparison" containing:
\itemize{
\item metrics: Named list of computed metrics.
\item edge_comparison: Data frame comparing edges from both models.
\item summary: Character summary of the comparison.
}
}
\description{
Compare two TNA network models using multiple metrics including correlation,
RMSE, and edge-level differences.
}
\details{
This function extracts edge weights from both models and computes various
comparison metrics. Edge weights are extracted from the transition matrices
stored in the TNA model objects.
